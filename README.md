# Cookiecutter ruby console project

This is rafadc's tiny template for a small console Ruby project, which I've modified to better fit my current setup.

# Usage

Once you run the cookie cutter just enter in the project and

``` shell
bundle install
```

## Automated testing

Start guard with

``` shell
bundle exec guard
```

## Debugging

To add new breakpoint just

``` ruby
binding.pry
```
